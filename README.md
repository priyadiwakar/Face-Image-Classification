# Face-Image-Classification

Face image classification

1. Implemented five generative classification models (based on MLE and EM algorithm) namely, Gaussian model, Mixture
of Gaussian model, T Distribution, Mixture of T Distribution and Factor Analysis on MATLAB.

2. Implemented simple neural network to get familiar with steps of
training neural networks. Built simple Neural Network architectures on
Tensorflow. Tuned different hyperparameters to observe effects on classifier performance.
