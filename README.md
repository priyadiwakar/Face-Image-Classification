# Face Recognition

Face Recognition
1. Using simple Neural Network 
Tuned different hyperparameters for simple Neural Network architectures on Tensorflow to observe effects on accuracy and performance. 

2. Using 5 Classification Models 
Trained and evaluated generative classification models (based on MLE and EM algorithm) namely, Gaussian model, Mixture of Gaussian model, T Distribution, Mixture of T Distribution and Factor Analysis on MATLAB.
